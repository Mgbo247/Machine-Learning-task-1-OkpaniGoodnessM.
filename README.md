One of the application area of machine learning of my choice is:

Topic: Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is an important application area of Machine Learning as it helps prevent financial losses and misuse of resources. Machine Learning algorithms can detect fraudulent activities in large datasets by identifying patterns from historical data that deviate from the normal behavior of legitimate customers. 

Problem Solving:

One of the ways Machine Learning solves fraud detection problem is by using anomaly detection algorithms. Anomaly detection algorithms can detect abnormalities or outliers in the data that don't conform to the normal patterns. These algorithms can flag transactions or activities that fall outside the normal range of expected patterns, enabling fraud analysts to investigate suspicious activities in real-time.

Dataset Repository:

The dataset repository for fraud detection can be found on Kaggle, which is a platform hosting several datasets on different problems. Kaggle has a wide range of datasets related to fraud detection, which include credit card fraud, telecom fraud, and insurance fraud. These datasets can be downloaded and used for training and testing machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities.

Solution/Machine Learning Algorithm:

For this solution, I will be using a Random Forest Classification algorithm. The Random Forest Classification algorithm is suitable for solving fraud detection problems because it is a highly accurate and effective algorithm. It can handle missing data and noise in the dataset, and it can also handle mixed data types effectively. The Random Forest algorithm can also handle large datasets with high dimensional features, which is common in fraud detection.
